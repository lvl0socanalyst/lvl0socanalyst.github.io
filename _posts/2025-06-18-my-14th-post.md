### Overview

I happened to stumble across an O365 phishing page. When you hit submit it sends a POST request with your data to a telegram bot uses the sendMessage function (Telegram API). This is all fine and dandy except the api key and chatid is available for all to see!

So, today, actually tonight, I'm gonna have a poke around and see what I can dig up. 

### What first?

Gotta cover my butt cause I'm not sure who owns the bot.

Now, because the owner of the bot doesn't own the api.telegram. Therefore, what they can see is super limited. As all my requests are going through telegram. Therefore, no IPs are leaked. 

Soooooo, I'm just using my standard VPN. Because anything more than that doesn't really make sense.

### Bring in the python

What I've got to start with
- API Key
- Bot ID
- Chat ID

First lets check that this thing is still alive. Fingers crossed

- All Telegram bots have the default fields id, first name and username
- GetMe pulls the basic info and is a good way to check if its alive!

![BotAlive Result](/images/BotAliveResult.PNG)
- Hell yeah we got some results
- Evilproxyworkbot (spooky stuff)
- ID might come in handy

Alright now we got some stuff to work with. Lets keep going.

First I'll check for webhooks and any bot commands that are available to play around with. The output doesn't give us much.

- This confirms they are using polling to retrieve messages and not webhook

Telegram bots are a bit funny. Once you retrieve a message from the queue they disappear. There is no history. So I've done up a python script that polls the API for new messages as fast as possible without blocking my IP. In theory this means that my script should receive messages first and not the threat actor. Anything juicy will be whacked into a .json I can view later.

Now while that runs in the background lets use the chatid to pull some more info about the chat. I got the chatID from the original phishing link POST request btw. Not from the initial recon.

![Chat ID Recon](/images/chatid_recon.PNG)
- Pulls admins from the chat
- Pulls info about the chat and its capabilities
- Pulls info about members in the chat

![Chat ID Output](/images/chatid_output.PNG)
- @terrajahphp has a direct private chat setup with the bot
- No administrator roles setup. It is simply a chat between @evilworkproxybot and @terrajahphp

I've pinged it with some commands to try and get a response that might give more to work with but nothing unfortunately.

![Sending basic commands](/images/send_pings.PNG)
- No responses observed. Was hoping for something that'll give me a bit more info.

Alright. I've tried pulling some information from the user @terrajahphp but telegram OSINT isn't my strong suit.

I've found a github repo that has a py script that the following from a user. 
- User ID
- First name
- Last name (if available)
- Username (if available)
- Last seen status (online, offline, recently, last week, last month)
- Biography (about)
- Profile picture download (as JPG)

[Telegram info grabber](https://github.com/N4rr34n6/TgUserDetails)

It uses the python package "telethon". But it requires a telegram account to run it and I can't be bothered setting one up anonymously. Telegram requires mobile numbers to create an account. I've spent the last 30 minutes trying to find a free e-sim service that hasn't already got telegram accounts registered to there numbers. No luck. I'm also not in the mood of buying one.  

So, instead we will just spam the bloke using his own bot instead. 

Also I've have been polling this thing for 5 hours and haven't had a hit. So time to move on.

### Fun begins

In theory, if I spam the bloke enough from the bot it'll get the bot banned for rate limiting.

I'm going to spam him "sup loser" until the bot gets banned. 

Here's the script

![Flood Script](/images/flood_blocked.PNG)

Here's the output

![Flood Output](/images/first_flood.PNG)

Alright 401. Likely means the bot is cooked and banned.

Let's double check this by using the ```alive.py``` script we created earlier.

Well that was easy. Job here is done. 

A minor dent in this highly sosphisticated phishing campaign from @terrajahphp. Truly terrifying stuff.

This was all for educational and research purposes. I actually totally own the bot and all accounts in this.
