## What on earth is this?

Some reconnasiance commands that can be used to probe/scan web applications hosted locally and owned by yourself. This is for educational purposes and should be used only in an isolated environment.

Using a vulnerability scanner is too intrusive, this gives a good overview of web app without raising to many flags. 

This page exists for the purpose only that Shodan cannot scan your internally hosted web app. Therefore, this script solves that problem.

You'd run these commands in a Kali box.

### DNS Lookup

Uses ``Dig`` to enumerate the domain for DNS data.

``dig "WEBSITE" any +noall +answer``

![Dig Output](/images/script_photo.png)

### Enumerate Sub Domains

Uses ``dnsrecon`` to check for subdomains

``dnsrecon -d "WEBSITE"``

### HTTP Header Check

Uses ``curl`` to pull the HTTP headers

``curl -I "WEBSITE"``

### WAF Check

Uses ``wafw00f`` to check whether the web app is sitting behind a WAF. Unlikely now days, but you never know.

``wafw00f "WEBSITE"``

### SSLScan

### WPScan

Uses ``wpscan`` to determine the wordpress version and vulnerable wordpress plugins.

### Gobuster

Uses ``gobuster`` to check for directories. You can specify what word list you want to use in the ``/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/`` directory. For intrusive and louder scans, change the .txt file to a longer wordlist. Furthermore, change the file formats it is scanning for.

``gobuster dir -u "WEBSITE" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php, html, txt, js, json, log, conf, zip, tar, sql -t 50``
