## What on earth is this?

Overview of my reconnasiance script that can be used to probe/scan web applications hosted locally and owned by yourself. This is for educational purposes and should be used only in an isolated environment.

Using a vulnerability scanner is too intrusive, this gives a good overview of web app. 

I'll go through each feature one by one and explain what it does. The script outputs to a .txt but the commands below have been adjusted to output to CLI. To get the whole script, check the bottom of page.

Script should be ran in a Kali box.

This script exists for the purpose only that Shodan cannot scan your internally hosted web app. Therefore, this script solves that problem.

## Progression

I'll add to this script overtime. There are so many possibilities here. Conditional statements if certain APIs are detected etc.

### DNS Lookup

Uses ``Dig`` to enumerate the domain for DNS data.

``dig "WEBSITE" any +noall +answer``

![Dig Output](/images/script_photo.png)

### Enumerate Sub Domains

Uses ``dnsrecon`` to check for subdomains

``dnsrecon -d "WEBSITE"``

### HTTP Header Check

Uses ``curl`` to pull the HTTP headers

``curl -I "WEBSITE"``

### WAF Check

Uses ``wafw00f`` to check whether the web app is sitting behind a WAF. Unlikely now days, but you never know.

``wafw00f "WEBSITE"``

### SSLScan


### WPScan

Uses ``wpscan`` to determine the wordpress version and vulnerable wordpress plugins.

### Gobuster

Uses ``gobuster`` to check for directories. You can specify what word list you want to use in the ``/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/`` directory. For intrusive and louder scans, change the .txt file to a longer wordlist. Furthermore, change the file formats it is scanning for.

``gobuster dir -u "WEBSITE" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php, html, txt, js, json, log, conf, zip, tar, sql -t 50``
