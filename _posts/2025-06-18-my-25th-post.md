## Overview

Clickfix prompt that asks users to allow push notifications? Why?

### Front-end

Here we can see a classic Cloudflare clickfix prompt. 

![alt text](/images/landing_page2.PNG)

However, when we hit that darn awful tick box we get this.

I can't explain how hard this stumped me.

Anyhow, let's dig into the back end. 


### Back-end

We have about 1000 lines of code here. First 650 lines is internal CSS and HTML (lame).

Booting up dev tools we can see the HTML and JS is stored locally on the webserver.

![alt text](/images/sources.PNG)

Only external call is for a .png file

Which hilariously is a transparent version of the CloudFlare logo. Pulling a CloudFlare logo from a free .png pasting website. Super legit.

![alt text](/images/png_call.PNG)

So that leaves us with this 'jq.js' file stored on the webserver. 

Alright we now have 268 lines of raw js, managable.

![alt text](/images/pub_key.PNG)

First we can see a public key I assume for an API of some sort. Looking juicy and totally not exploitable already.

![alt text](/images/base_64.PNG)

Hmmmm, this is interesting. Looks like it takes a B64 string and converts it to a Uint8Array using ``window.atob``

![alt text](/images/memer.PNG)

Function name is hilarious. Great to know the nefarious folks are memers too.

But seriously, this function sends the text 'yep' to 'index.php' using a POST request. Then waits for a response. If the response status is "success" is redirects to the homepage, hence the ``./``

Now, the fact this is commented out makes me believe this is MaaS. But can't be certain yet. Looks to be the .js function for creating the push notification popup for Samsung and IOS users.

Another Ajax POST request. This time to a .php file on the domain ``xtolz[.]com``

Sends a POST request in JSON format to ``xtolz[.]com``. If the response is "success" it'll run the meme function from earlier (OkeyNice()). Which essentially redirects the user to the homepage of ``hyroalabs[.]site``

Now in terms of exfil. What have we got.
- endpoint
- public_key
- auth_token
- content_encoding

First I thought these we're variables. But they aren't anywhere else in the code. So that means they exist somehow natively in the browser and are known values. 

A quick google lead me to PushManager.

PushManager is browser API that can allow a web application to send push notifications to a browser client.

So the function above. Is subscribing us, the user to the receive push notifications from ``xtolz[.]com``

Now to blow your mind (and mine rn) this means that the ``xtolz[.]com`` can send push notifications to my isolated browser at any point in time. Until I remove it.

This is the function that creates the subscription.

The VAPID key is a public key for the push notification flow. The private key lives on the server. And the public key lives within the js of the site. The public/private key are used to generate a PushSubscription object that then lives in the user's browser. This objects allows the registered domain to send push notifications to the user's browser.

Enter exfil info

Alright interesting. Can see here that this is likely created by 'GROWCRM.IO' 

![alt text](/images/dork.PNG)

Quick dork shows that they are a CRM offering. Interesting. Two things that may have occurred here. The website itself has a vulnerability that has allowed for code injection. Or the admin account for the GrowCRM.io for hyoralabs has been compromised and the code appended to the site.

### What is xtolz[.]com?

Clickfix prompt sends the POST request to the xtolz[.]com. So what is it? And what is the URL? Looks like a panel.. But for what?

Well looks like we have a marketplace. 

![alt text](/images/offerings.PNG)

This is everything they sell. CPanel and Shell access for example. Along with a load of other stuff. 

But that still doesn't answer why the push subscription sends a POST request to this? I'm a touch confused. 

It would seem like there is backend functionality on the site to accept these push subscriptions. So I feel like the site was compromised by the owner of xtolz[.]com

Kind of cool.

![alt text](/images/shell.PNG)

$3 for shell access to a website. Neat. This is darn cheap.

### Counter attack?

Wellllll.... If we have a look at the original POST request. It passes in some json data to an API assumedly that lives at xtolz[.]com

So we could check what other HTTP methods we can hit it with. E.g. GET?

But that is all hypothetical, of course.

### How to remove subscriptions?

Site Settings --> Notifications --> Block or Remove

### Threat actor attribution?
