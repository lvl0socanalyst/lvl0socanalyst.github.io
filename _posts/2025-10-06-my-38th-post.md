## Overview

More malicious browser extensions, who would've thought.

Prompt poaching has been dubbed as an attack method where attackers utilise browser extensions to exfiltrate user prompts to AI agents.

Today well actually tonight I'm going to explain what this is and try to get a grasp of why threat actors are doing this and not just dropping phishing redirects or even browser extension based C2s to victims.

### Why browser extensions are bad

Few dot points for those late to the party

1. Auto-update and can silently update
2. Minimal security controls with browser visibility (DOM) giving extensions free entry to the party.
3. Can inject scripts at the transport layer
4. Miniture applications that have full control over your browser (no kidding)

### DarkSpectre Threat Actor

KoiSecurity released a report on the 30th of December attributing three major malicious browser extension campaigns (Shady Panda, ZoomStealer and GhostPoster) to a Chinese threat actor dubbed 'DarkSpectre'.

Campaigns:
- Shady Panda (Spyware) - Keylogger with spyware capabilities.
- ZoomStealer (Corporate Intel) - Zoom meeting meta data stealer.
- GhostPoster (Trojan/C2) - Logic bomb with a three day time delay before initiating a C2 connection. 

All three campaigns by the one actor had completely different objectives, which is interesting in itself.

The most impressive by far was ShadyPanda. They had a legitimate extension running for seven years before they pushed the malicious update to it silently turning it into spyware.

Attribution by KoiSecurity was neat. They'd found that other extensions we're communicating with the domains from the extension 'Infinity New Tab', which was apart of the ShadyPanda campaign.

Lastly, attribution to China was discovered in the following ways:
- Alibaba Cloud hosting C2s in China
- ICP registrations linked to Hubei provinces
- Chinese language strings through code
- Chinese comments
- Development patterns consistent with Chinese timezone activity

### Corporate Data Stealing Campaign

The ZoomStealer campaign crafted extensions to steal the following:
- Meeting IDs
- Topics
- Descriptions
- Scheduled times
- Registration status
- Embedded passwords
- Hosts names/titles/bios/profile photos

Take this data into context of a broader goal and it becomes quite terrifying.

There is no reason why the TA couldn't have held off and pushed a C2 to this fleet of extensions down the track. Furthermore, target specific users based on the intelligence gathered from the data above.

This by far was the most interesting for me. Why this, when you literally have workable code for a full blown browser-based C2 in your arsenal.

### Following same path as KoiSecurity for Chinese Attribution

Lets delve into the ``infinitynewtab.com`` domain. Both extensions in the ZoomStealer and ShadyPanda campaigns we're caught making fetch calls to this domain.

``nslookup`` fails as the domain is now down, looks like someone got caught!

However historical DNS records on Validin, point to this IP ``8.141.165.98``

When we look this IP up, we can see it is Alibaba China in the Hubei province

### Summary

There's probably a million more extensions out there slowly building up a fan base of negligent users who continue to install Chinese spyware to improve productivity.

This will not stop happening.
