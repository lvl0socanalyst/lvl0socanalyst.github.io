## Overview

More malicious browser extensions, who would've thought.

Prompt poaching has been dubbed in a functionality used in malicious browser extensions to exfilitrate prompts a user sends to AI agents.

Here I'm going to explain what this is, give an example and try to get a grasp of why threat actors are doing this and not just dropping phishing redirects or even browser extension based C2s

### Why browser extensions are bad

Few dot points for those late to the party

1. Auto-update and can silently update
2. No security controls with browser visibility (DOM)
3. Can inject scripts at the transport layer
4. Miniture applications that have full control over your browser (no kidding)

### DarkSpectre Threat Actor

KoiSecurity released a report on the 30th of December attributing the last three major malicious browser extension campaigns (Shady Panda, ZoomStealer and GhostPoster) to a Chinese threat actor they're calling 'DarkSpectre'.

Campaigns:
Shady Panda (Spyware) - Pretty much a keylogger with other spyware capabilities tied in
ZoomStealer (Corporate Intel) - Steals zoom meeting invites and meta data in HTTP headers
GhostPoster (Trojan/C2) - Three day logic bomb before extension activating C2 infrastructure 

All three campaigns by the one actor had completely different objectives, which is interesting in itself.

The most impressive by far was ShadyPanda. They had a legitimate extension running for seven years before they pushed the malicious update to it silently turning it into spyware.

Attribution by KoiSecurity was pretty cool. They'd found that other extensions we're communicating with the domains from the extension 'Infinity New Tab', which was apart of the ShadyPanda campaign.

Lastly, attribution to China was discovered in the following ways
- Alibaba Cloud hosting C2s in China
- ICP registrations linked to Hubei provinces
- Chinese language strings through code
- Chinese comments
- Development patterns consistent with Chinese timezone activity

### Corporate Data Stealing Campaign

The ZoomStealer campaign crafted extensions to steal the following:
- Meeting IDs
- Topics
- Descriptions
- Scheduled times
- Registration status
- Embedded passwords
- Hosts names/titles/bios/profile photos

Take this data into context of a broader goal and it becomes quite terrifying.

There is no reason why the TA couldn't have held off and pushed a C2 to this fleet of extensions down the track. Furthermore, target specific users based on the intelligence gathered from the data above.

This by far was the most interesting for me. Why this, when you literally have workable code for a full blown browser-based C2 in your arsenal.

### Following same path as KoiSecurity for Chinese Attribution

Lets delve into the ``infinitynewtab.com`` domain. Both extensions in the ZoomStealer and ShadyPanda campaigns we're caught making fetch calls to this domain.

``nslookup`` fails as the domain is now down, looks like someone got caught!

Historical DNS records on Validin point however, point to this IP ``8.141.165.98``

When we look this IP up, we can see it is Alibaba China in the Hubei province

### Summary

There's probably a million more extensions out there slowly building up a fan base of negligent users who continue to install Chinese spyware to improve productivity.

This will not stop happening.
