### Overview

A mate recommended I have a go at analysing a compromised 2022 windows server that was done by ransomware.

You can download the E01 here.

On my mate's website there are 14 questions that we should answer to close off the incident. I'll be going through one by one doing that and detailing the steps I took to get there. 

Anyhow, I'll be using ftkimager and autopsy to sift through the EO1 cause I'm not sponsored by the CCP.
