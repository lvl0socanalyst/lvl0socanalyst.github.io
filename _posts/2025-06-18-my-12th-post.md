## Overview

Researchers at Koi Security released a report labelling a group of browser extensions as malicious.

This campaign followed a similar pattern to its predecessors.

1. Purchase trusted browser extension from the developer who created it
2. Inject malicious code into the extension
3. Causes the extension to auto-update, adding the malicious code
4. Action on objectives:
- Exfiltrate session tokens and cookies
- Redirect browser requests through a domain of their choosing (MITM)
- Take screenshots of the browser
- Steal MFA tokens
- Monitor websites user is visiting
- Receive commands from a C2

2.3 million users were affected and a number of trusted extensions were found to have the same malicious code.

This attack has affected both Chrome and Edge. The sophisticated nature of the attack highlights the importance of whitelisting browser extensions and allowing by exception, as threat actors are beginning to catch onto a major control gap.

For a more detailed write-up on how to create one of these extensions and how/why the visibility gap exists, have a read through an older post of mine [InfoStealer Browser Extension](https://lvl0socanalyst.github.io/project/2025/06/16/my-eight-post.html)

### Breakdown of the code

Extension ID: eckokfcjbjbgjifpcbdmengnabecdakp

Good thing about extensions are most of them are unpacked, meaning the code is fully interpretable and no reverse engineering is actually needed.

The ```manifest.json``` gives the format of the extension - essentially the skeleton. 

![Manifest.json](/images/manifest.PNG)

Worker script = ```sw.js```
Content scripts = ```content-popup.js``` and ```dark-theme-content.js```

Alright, next I’ll look at ```sw.js``` for fetch or HTTP. This will give me a solid idea of what the C2 domain is and under what condition triggers the call.

At the end of the file there's a fetch to the domain click[.]darktheme[.]net
- Poor reputation of domain via OSINT [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/click.darktheme.net/detection)
- HTTP POST request sent to the domain
- Uses the chrome.tabs api to invoke the fetch everytime a tab is updated (chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener)

![Fetch](/images/fetch_to_domain.PNG)

From the fetch command I've been led down the rabbit hole and discovered a real dodgy .js key

```initListeners``` has a switch statement with a switch statement. It looks like remote instructions that are likely being received from click[.]darktheme[.]net.

- Calls Chrome API chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab to take a screenshot of your browser (case "make_screenshot")

- Calls Chrome API chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener and recieves a URL from the function t()

![OpenLink](/images/open_link.PNG)

After trying to search the two case values across the .js file(s) I can’t find any reference to it. This means the commands aren’t invoked locally and are received externally. This is pretty darn bad. Therefore, essentially I’ve found C2 commands.

There is so much dodgy stuff in here I’m not sure what to look at next. 19,000 lines of code to sort through. However, it seems the last 5,000 lines contain most of the spicy goods.

Okay so there are way more potential C2 case statements. I can see a bunch of functions named k, g, f etc. These all have different purposes and call different Chrome APIs — many creating fetch requests. The code is actually really well written. I’m going from one hole to another and finding it difficult to trace back values/purpose of functions as there are so many variables floating about.

chrome.tabs.sendMessage is used to communicate with the C2 I believe. Need to have another look with fresh eyes.

Alright, new day new brain.

Searching the chrome.tabs.sendMessage API across the files I’ve had a decent hit on one function. It’s a legitimate API used to send messages between the worker and content scripts but it looks to be also calling the malicious functions.

Function lt() looks to use fetch to allow content scripts to contact URLs.

Alright, there’s a lot going on here. I think the best method forward is to dig into the domain click[.]darktheme[.]net a touch more. From there if it’s still responding I’ll whack the extension in a sandbox and try and capture some activity.

The domain resolves to two IPs. Both behind Cloudflare so little information we can get there. Seems to be a reverse proxy masking the legitimate C2 IP, neat I guess.

![nslookup](/images/nslookup.PNG)

I've hit the point of extreme obfuscation. I don't have the brain for it right now. So instead I'm going to whack it in a VM and see what activity we can capture.

Should be able to see some good detail from the Chrome Dev Console, I'll run a .pcap as well. 

### Live Malware Analysis

Standard W10 VM Pro VM. For peace of mind I'm on a shitty free VPN. 

Anyhow, lets install this and see what we can see.

### Conclusion

Prewriting this cause I already know its a browser trojan just haven't compiled enough yet.
