## Overview

Researchers at Koi Security released a report labeling a group of browser extensions as malicious.

This campaign followed a similar pattern to its predescessors. 
1. Purchase trusted browser extension from the developer who created it
2. Inject malicious code into the extension
3. Causes the extension to auto-update. Adding the malicious code.
4. Action on objectives
- Exfilitrate session tokens and cookies
- Redirect browser requests through a domain of there choosing (MITM)
- Take screenshots of the browser
- Steal MFA tokens
- Monitor websites user is visiting

2.3 million users we're affected and a number of trusted extensions we're found to have the same malicious code.

This attack has affected both Chrome and Edge. The sophisiticated nature of the attack highlights the importance of whitelisting browser extensions and allowing by exception. As threat actors are beginning to catch onto a major control gap. 

For a more detailed writeup on how to create one of these extensions and how/why the visibility gap exists have a read through an older post of mine [InfoStealer Browser Extension](https://lvl0socanalyst.github.io/project/2025/06/16/my-eight-post.html)

### Breakdown of the code

Extension ID: eckokfcjbjbgjifpcbdmengnabecdakp

Good thing about extensions are most of them are unpacked. Meaning the code is full interpretable and no reverse engineering is actually needed.

The manifest.json gives the format of the extension. Essentially a skeleton of the extension. 

(ATTACH SCREENSHOT)

Worker script = ```sw.js```
Content scripts = ```content-popup.js``` and ```dark-theme-content.js```

Alright, next I'll look at ```sw.js``` for fetch or http. This will give me a solid idea of what the c2 domain is and under what condition triggers the call.

At the end of the file there's a fetch to the domain click[.]darktheme[.]net
- Poor reputation of domain via OSINT [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/click.darktheme.net/detection)
- HTTP POST request sent to the domain
- Uses the chrome.tabs api to invoke the fetch everytime a tab is updated (chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener)

From the fetch command I've been led down the rabbit hole and discovered a real dodgy .js key

```initListeners``` has a switch statement with some odd case statements. This is bad. It looks like remote instructions that are likely being received from click[.]darktheme[.]net

- Calls Chrome API chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab to take a screenshot of your browser (case "make_screenshot")

(INSERT SCREENSHOT)

- Calls Chrome API chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener and redirects current tab to the domain t[.]link" (case "open_link")

(INSERT SCREENSHOT)

After trying to search the two case statements across the .js file and others I can't find it. This means the commands aren't invoked locally and received externally. This is pretty darn bad. Therefore, essentially I've found C2 commands.

---Other concerning findings---

be.UI_SAVE_FILE
- Triggers a download by creating an anchor and clicking it

There is so much dodgy stuff in here I'm not sure what to look at next. 19000 lines of code to sort through. However, it seems the last 5000 lines contain most of the spicy goods.

Okay so there are way more potential C2 case statements. I can see a bunch of functions named k, g, f etc. These all have different functions and call different Chrome APIs. Many creating fetch requests. The code is actually really well written. I'm going from one hole to another and finding it difficult to trace back values/purpose of functions as there are so many variables floating about. 

Anyway, the function K

(Pseudocode from ChatGPT)

```function K(e) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (g) {
      // XMLHttpRequest branch
    } else if (y) {
      // fetch() branch
    } else {
      reject(new Error("Neither XMLHttpRequest nor Fetch API are accessible!"));
    } 
  });
}```
- Accepts e as an object and loads a URL using fetch or XMLHTTPRequest
- Returns the contents as a string 

chrome.tabs.sendMessage is used to communicate with the C2 I believe. Need to have another look with fresh eyes.
