## Overview

How to purchase monero anonymously on the world's greatest P2P exchange.

### Why Haveno

Haveno is decentralised network where you can exchange XMR for fiat currency (government currency). Why is this good? Well because no central entities are involved in the trade. 

When trading on exchanges like Binance and Coinbase a central entity exists, that being the platform.
- Control user accounts
- Ability to freeze/block transactions
- Verification methods required

Whereas Haveno, is peer-to-peer. No one controls it. Trades occur between a maker and taker, that is it.

Haveno is a fork from Bisq. If you haven't heard of Bisq is it's practically Haveno but for Bitcoin. Bisq had some underlying privacy concerns which led to the creation of Haveno.

Haveno is built on the Tor network. So every request is routed through Tor nodes. Thus, adding another layer of anonymity to the platform.

### KYC and Non-KYC



### Logistics

Haveno exists as a great way for people to cash out crypto safely and privately.

However, Haveno won't allow you to purchase crypto with a CC. Currently these are the fiat payment methods available.
- Bank Transfers
- Cash in Person
- Cash by Mail
- Digital Payment Services (Revolut)

So for the ultra paranoid 'Cash by Mail' is clearly the way to go.

However, say you we're based in Italy and someone was selling XMR for euro's. You could transfer money to there bank through a local bank transfer and receive the monero. Now no one has to know what/why this purchase occurred. Because no one is facilitating it. But yourself(taker) and the seller(maker).
