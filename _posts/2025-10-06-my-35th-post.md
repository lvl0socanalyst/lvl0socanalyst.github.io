### Overview

Dumping ground for all my thoughts as completing the PortSwigger labs. I'll handpick a few labs that I find interesting/relevant and discuss them here.

## Expert Labs

## Practitioner/Apprentice Labs

### GraphQL
Query language and runtime for APIs, good alternative to RestAPI. GraphQL differs in that it has a single endpoint where the client specifies exactly what they need. Whereas for REST you tell it everything you don't need and it gives you the rest(pun not intended).

Determine whether the Web App uses GraphQL
``query{__typename}``

Common GraphQL endpoints
- ``/graphql``
- ``/api``
- ``/api/graphql``
- ``/graphql/api``
- ``/graphql/graphql``
- ``/v1``

Hit the any of the above endpoints with this in a POST request to try and return the __schema
``{"query":"query { __schema { types { name } } }"}``

Or even easier you can use ``clairvoyance`` after you identify the graphql endpoint on the site
``clairvoyance https://target.com/graphql``

The __schema is the keys to the kingdom. Essentially a blueprint of all the endpoint and what is accepted where.
- What queries, mutations and subscriptions exist
- Fields

``inQL`` is a burp extension that can be used to enumerate schemas and generate queries/mutations.
