## Overview

In September 2025, China's Great Wall was leaked. Configuration files, packet inspection algorithms, network topologies, project management data and entensive data connecting the entities that operate and maintain the infrastructure.

The cause of the breach unknown. No one has claimed responsbility, the leak was anonymous.

To put this into scale, over 100,000 documents we're leaked. People are still analysing the files. On this page I am going to go through everything we know as of now and try to put into words how bad this leak is for China.

### What has been leaked

- RPM packaging server files
- Configuration files
- Project management data
- Chain of command documents
- Companies associated with the firewall
- Honeypot data

### Associates of the firewall

Ever bought an E-Sim in South East Asia? If so, it is likely the traffic was routed through the GFW.
- China Telecom
- China Unicom
- China Mobile

These three telecommunications providers have been linked to the GFW.
