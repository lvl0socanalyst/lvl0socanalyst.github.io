## Overview

In September 2025, China's Great Wall was leaked. Configuration files, packet inspection algorithms, network topologies, project management data and entensive data connecting the entities that operate and maintain the infrastructure.

The cause of the breach unknown. No one has claimed responsbility, the leak was anonymous.

To put this into scale, over 100,000 documents we're leaked. People are still analysing the files. On this page I am going to go through everything we know as of now and try to put into words how bad this leak is for China.

### GFW Objective

To reduce outside noise. The less your citizens are exposed to what is really going on, the more you can influence them. Keep citizens inside the bubble and free of creative ideas and realisations of the control and power of those above. 

### What has been leaked

- RPM packaging server files
- Configuration files
- Project management data
- Chain of command documents
- Companies associated with the firewall
- Honeypot data

Out of all the above, my clear favourite is the honeypot data. I find it crazy that China had multiple honeypots setup to intercept and analyse attack traffic. So cool. Reaffirms the undeniable evidence that suggests China is highly capable state sponsored leader in defensive and offensive Cybersecurity. 

### Associates of the firewall

Right at the top of the chain of command is CNCERT (National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China).
 
Ever bought an E-Sim in South East Asia? If so, it is likely the traffic was routed through the GFW. 
- China Telecom
- China Unicom
- China Mobile

These telecoms have deployed custom routing devices with DPI modules created by Huaxin, Venustech and Topsec. These are marketed and referred to as "smart gateways". 

Why build your own fingerprinting when you can get a bunch of University students to do it. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and Tsinghua University developed SNI detection and VPN fingerprinting algorithms.

### What data is collected?

This is far more than sinking requests to blacklisted domains, this is a full fledged surveillance solution.

For each end user device they collect the following
- Device Type
- IP Address
- Bandwidth
- Usage rate
- Responsible party (telecom)

One cool finding is a user's browsing session is assigned a real time risk score. If the risk score increases they're traffic is redirected to DPI capable routing devices, which in turn can terminate the session if anything suspicious is flagged. It's important to note this is all occuring in real-time and is fully automated. 

### What this means for the rest of the world

Well if anything this leak illustrates the intrusiveness of a censored internet, furthermore, the treasure trove of data it can provide. 

Deployment records suggest that China has exported this solution to Myanmar, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and Kazakhstan.

As highly sosphiticated as this solution is, it is equally terrifying. It demonstrates what is possible when telecoms work in unison with a surveillance state. There is no reason this solution could not adopted in other parts of the world.
