## Overview

BrowserBuddy - Chrome Extension. 

A browser extension that prevents dodgy JavaScript. 

With Clickfix prompts on the rise, malicious browser extensions and drive by downloads tearing apart the real OS (the browser) I thought up this idea.

This by no means is something new. However, the scope is kind of endless with this. The idea is too slowly build this out and see where it goes. 

## Features

These will be added to overtime.

### BrowserBuddy Toggle 

Functionality to be toggled on/off

### Exclude Domains from BrowserBuddy 

To avoid breaking website functionality browserbuddy allows users to exclude domains.

Here is an example of me trying to copy some text from Cyberchef.

As you can see it doesn't work!

So let's create an exclusion.

![Stage 1](/images/browser_buddy_exclusion.PNG)

We whack our domain into the box above and hit the magic button.

As you can see the exclusion has been created. Now let's test it.

Now I can use CyberChef without having to turn the extension off.

These exclusions are saved locally. Therefore, when users restart there browsers the exclusion list remains. 
- chrome.storage.local

### Blocking JavaScript Clipboard APIs

First successful addition to this is the blocking of JS Clipboard APIs. 

There are two JS APIs that trigger this. Both of them suck
- navigator.clipboard.writeText()
- document.execCommand()

Essentially I have blocked the 'programmatic' copy to a user's clipboard. 

What can still happen: 
- Ctrl+C 
- Right click --> Copy 

What can't happen:
- Webpages copying text automatically to clipboard using JS APIs
- User cannot click a copy button on a website

So business impact? Sounding real corporate. Users unable to interact with copy buttons on websites.

To demonstrate the functionality I'll boot up a live Clickfix prompt and see how BrowserBuddy behaves.


1. Navigate to ClickFix site with BrowserBuddy installed

2. BrowserBuddy blocks the JS programmatic copy=======

3. BrowserBuddy prints the command to the log
