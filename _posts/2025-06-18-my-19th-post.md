## Overview

BrowserBuddy - Chrome Extension. 

A browser extension that prevents dodgy JavaScript. 

With Clickfix prompts on the rise, malicious browser extensions and drive by downloads tearing apart the real OS (the browser) I thought up this idea.

This by no means is something new. However, the scope is kind of endless with this. 

I will keep it simple to start off, and build overtime.

## Features

All features will be able to be enabled/disabled/modifed by the user on a website basis.

### Blocking JavaScript Clipboard APIs



### Prevent Drive-By Downloads
