## Overview

BrowserBuddy - Chrome Extension. 

A browser extension that prevents dodgy JavaScript. 

With Clickfix prompts on the rise, malicious browser extensions and drive by downloads tearing apart the real OS (the browser) I thought up this idea.

This by no means is something new. However, the scope is kind of endless with this. The idea is too slowly build this out and see where it goes. 

## Features

These will be added to overtime.

### BrowserBuddy Toggle 

BrowserBuddy will be able to be toggled on/off 

Potential improvements
- Exclusions for certain domains

### Blocking JavaScript Clipboard APIs

First successful addition to this is the blocking of JS Clipboard APIs. 

There are two JS APIs that trigger this. Both of them suck
- navigator.clipboard.writeText()
- document.execCommand()

Essentially I have blocked the 'programmatic' copy to a user's clipboard. 

What can still happen: 
- Ctrl+C 
- Right click --> Copy 

What can't happen:
- Webpages copying text automatically to clipboard using JS APIs
- User cannot click a copy button on a website

So business impact? Sounding real corporate. User's are unable to interact with buttons that copy stuff to there clipboard.

To demonstrate the functionality I'll boot up a live Clickfix prompt and see how BrowserBuddy behaves.

We've navigated to a malicious domain with BrowserBuddy installed.

BrowserBuddy blocks the JS programmatic copy. 

![Stage 3](/images/browser_buddy_log.PNG)

BrowserBuddy prints the command to the log.

### Prevent Drive-By Downloads
