## Overview

Attempting to track IOCs for the S1nguarlity npm package incident.

## Phishing IOCs

Here's the domain that was used to send the phishing emails to our npm package owner.
- npmjs[.]help

Now let's see what we can find out about this domain.

First off, looks like it's down. Which is annoying.

Let's check some OSINT for historical DNS records.

Ok cool, we can see they use PorkBun as a DNS registrar. 

Because, the domain is down, and active subdomain reconnaissance can be illegal I'll check with my pals at Validin to see what they have.

Looks like we have 5 subdomains. Cool, let's dig into data[.]npmjs[.]help

BunnyCDN. Bummer, nothing here to see.

Alright this is helpful. We have an IP that is hosting the domain. Lets check where this lives and pull some information about it.

So a little to unpack here. 

Two ports open SSH and TCP. SSH is great and should give us some nice pivot points.

ASN is WorldStream. First time hearing of them for me. Netherlands, classic.

Tried pivoting from the SSL cert SHA but no luck.

This is interesting, just read a report with some further pivot points.

Okay, so supposedly, there we're credential stealer scripts loaded from the above domain. Let's see where it resolves.

The domain itself looks to be a free domain name. So unfortunately, the domain won't mean a whole lot. Has a very poor rep on VT.

However, it resolves to ``54.36.175.67``

![alt text](/images/npm_resolve.PNG)

No similarities to the IP that ``npm.js`` resolved to. 

However, we have some interesting findings here.

When google dorking the IP we can see an old Facebook post from 2021 advertising a gaming server on that IP. 

{INSERT}

This when translated from dutch reads "Not online, but this weekend [EU] Rustag 54.36.175.67:25566"

This port is no longer open as per Shodan. However, it is interesting. Unfortunately the group is private so I cannot see who made the post. However, I'll create an account and try to join the group.
