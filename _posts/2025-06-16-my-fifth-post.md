### Overview
- VT Premium costs an arm and a leg
- With a non-paid account you can call the API about 500 times a month and 1 call per 15 seconds
- I have a range of scripts here that call the virustotal api that may come in handy
- So you might be pretty slow at triaging.... but atleast you don't have to pay
