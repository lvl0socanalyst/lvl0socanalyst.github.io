## Overview

Acreed Infostealer is a lightweight infostealer that targets information stored in the browser. Samples analysed have seen Acreed target web cookies, saved passwords, cryptocurrency wallets and session tokens. Acreed logs are often only 1-2mbs in size in comparison to LummaStealer logs that can be upwards of 10mb. After the Lumma takedown efforts in May by law inforcement, Acreed has soared in popularity on 'Russian Market'. 

I'll be going over the following.

### History and Author

Acreed first appeared publically in Feburary 14th 2025, not for sale however. The log dump referenced 'acreed' as the stealer. I cannot find anything on markets or see any reference to the stealer being sold and offered as MaaS.

### Capabilities

Acreed primarily focuses on stealing from the browser. Why? Probably because EDRs can't detect suspicious activity that occurs at the DOM level in the browser. 

Furthermore, has the keys to the kingdom. Session tokens and cookies are what attackers are after as it opens up the possibility for MFA bypasses.

### Infrastructure

Acreed's loader uses the BNB Smartchain Testnet and Steam profiles to fetch payloads.

BNB Smartchain Testnet is a simulated blockchain environment. This allows the attackers to create BNB smart contracts with encrypted payloads for free. Usually on a proper blockchain you would have to pay a gas fee for every transaction. Therefore, each time you fetch the smart contract code you pay. In a simulated environment, this is free. However, this technique relies on the testnet not removing the addresses. As of today, the smart contracts have been up for three months on the platform and they have yet to be removed. Fetching payloads from smart contracts is a technique called EtherHiding.
