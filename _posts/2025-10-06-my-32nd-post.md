## Overview

Acreed Infostealer is a lightweight infostealer targeting data stored in the browser. Samples analysed have seen Acreed target web history, cookies, session tokens, saved passwords and cryptocurrency wallets. Acreed logs are often only 1-2mbs in size which differs in comparison to LummaStealer logs that can be upwards of 10mb. After the Lumma takedown efforts in May by law inforcement, Acreed has soared in popularity on Russian Markets. 

### History

Acreed first appeared publically in Feburary 14th 2025, however, not for sale. There was a random log dump screenshot referencing 'acreed' as the stealer. After poking around for a good hour I cannot find anything on markets or see any reference to the stealer being sold and offered as MaaS. 

Therefore, I think it's likely Acreed is a closed market stealer, purchased only by a handful of sophisticated threat actors. Certainly not in Lvl0SocAnalyst domains. 

There has been a few domains hosting Acreed that have previously hosted Vidar infostealer. Given that Vidar is MaaS, this has kicked off rumours that the two are somehow related. However, it is not known whether the domains we're used in Vidar's MaaS network infrastructure offering or if it was owned by a threat actor that purchased the malware.

Therefore, no author is known.

### Capabilities

Acreed has MAC and Windows variants. 

Targeting the crown jewels (the browser) to find the keys to the kingdom. 
- Session tokens and cookies opening up possibile MFA bypasses. 
- Stored passwords. Useful for legacy sites but also pass spraying a user across multiple apps, hoping for password re-use.
- If anyone is stupid enough, a browser extension crypto wallet ready to drain.

This is the output of the logs that are being sold on 'Russian Market'. Logs are lightweight, making exfilitration simple and less likely to raise red flags.

Acreed injects malicious javascript modules into the current browsing session. This is a highly effective method for evading detection as EDRs have no telemetry into what occurs at the Document Object Model (DOM) level of the browser. 

The crypto stealing modules permanently hinder the functionality of the crypto extensions. The script running in the browser intercepts private keys and RPC requests made from the extensions and re-routes crypto to there address.

Unlike LummaStealer it does not drop a persistent backdoor after exfilitration. Personally I like this. Dropping a backdoor can be noisy and the beaconing is very likley to raise a detection on any modern EDR. 

### Staging Infrastructure

Acreed utilises the technique of drop dead resolving. This refers to storing payloads and domains on legitimate web services.

Compromised web applications have been observed using the BNB Smartchain Testnet to fetch Clickfix commands that kick off the Acreed infection chain.

BNB Smartchain Testnet is a simulated blockchain environment. This allows the attackers to create BNB smart contracts with encrypted payloads for free. Usually on a proper blockchain you would have to pay a gas fee for every transaction. Each time you fetch the smart contract code you'd have to pay. However, in a simulated environment, this is free. This of course relies on the testnet not removing the addresses. 

As of today, some smart contract addresses I fetched from an Acreed ClickFix delivery payload are still up. It's been three months and they're yet to be removed. To be fair, the smart contract on the testnet is heavily encrypted. You are only able to decrypt the payload in the smart contract using the decryption method found in the JS of the compromised website. So for the testnet, I guess it's blind negligence.

The technique of fetching payloads from smart contracts is called EtherHiding.

Besdies smart contracts like the one above. Acreed droppers have been observed fetching C2 domains and further payloads from Steam Profiles as well.

Above is an Acreed steam profile with what looks to be a few hex encoded strings, likely heavily encrypted like the smart contracts.

Both these methods utilise the technique called used as the domains are highly resilent to takedowns. Also, these two domains are unlikely to ever gain a poor reputation, therefore, they fly under the radar and evade detections. Furthermore, organisations are unlikely to treat these two domains as suspicious. If you don't have a detection in place that triggers upon this occuring, I highly recommend doing so. 

### C2/Malware Infrastructure

Acreed pings out and fetches malicious .JS from one of three domains. 
- acreed-update[.]tech
- smart-chain-node[.]info
- steam-data-hub[.]com

As per usual, these sit behind Cloudflare. So blocking the IP isn't really an option.

There are variety of scripts that are pulled and run in the browser.
- hoodpay.js
- cryptomus.js
- fixedfloat.js
- script.js
- bitrefill.js
- Sellix.js

### Prevention

From top to bottom in my opinon these are the most effective solutions:
1. Browser-Based Detection and Response (BDR) Solution (LayerX or SquareX)
2. Security Browser Extension to Prevent Clickfix [BrowserBuddy](https://lvl0socanalyst.github.io/project/2025/08/10/my-19th-post.html)
3. Isolated Browser
4. [ZeroAttackPrevention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

If you aren't keen on a BDR you are relying on your proxy to block these domains upon connection requests, and your proxy is only as good as its blocklist.
