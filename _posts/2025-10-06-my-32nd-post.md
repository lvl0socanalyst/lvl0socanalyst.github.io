## Overview

Acreed Infostealer is a lightweight infostealer that targets information stored in the browser. Samples analysed have seen Acreed target browser data such as web history, cookies, session tokens, saved passwords and cryptocurrency wallets. Acreed logs are often only 1-2mbs in size in comparison to LummaStealer logs that can be upwards of 10mb. After the Lumma takedown efforts in May by law inforcement, Acreed has soared in popularity on 'Russian Market'. 

### History

Acreed first appeared publically in Feburary 14th 2025, not for sale however. The log dump referenced 'acreed' as the stealer. I cannot find anything on markets or see any reference to the stealer being sold and offered as MaaS. 

This is why people believe that Acreed is a closed market. Likely purchased by a handful of sophisticated threat actors. There has been a few domains hosting Acreed that have previously hosted Vidar infostealer. Given that Vidar is MaaS, this has kicked off rumours that the two are somehow related. However, it is not known whether the domains we're used in Vidar's MaaS network infrastructure offering or if it was owned by a threat actor that purchased the malware.

Therefore, no author is known.

### Capabilities

Acreed primarily focuses on stealing from the browser. The malware has Mac and Windows variants. 

The browser has the keys to the kingdom. Session tokens and cookies are what attackers are after as it opens up the possibility for MFA bypasses. Furthermore, stored passwords and if anyone is stupid enough, a browser extension crypto wallet ready to drain.

This is the output of the logs that are being sold on 'Russian Market'. We can see the logs are quite lightweight. Making exfilitration simple and unlikely to raise red flags.

Acreed steals the above through injecting malicious javascript modules into the current browsing session. This is a highly effective method for evading detection as EDRs have no telemetry into what occurs at the Document Object Model (DOM) level of the browser. 

The crypto stealing modules permanently hinder the functionality of the crypto extensions. The script running in the browser intercepts private keys and RPC requests made from the extensions and re-routes crypto to there address.

### Infrastructure

Acreed utilises the technique of drop dead resolving. This refers to storing payloads and domains on legitimate web services.

Compromised web applications have been observed using the BNB Smartchain Testnet to fetch Clickfix commands that kick off Acreed.

BNB Smartchain Testnet is a simulated blockchain environment. This allows the attackers to create BNB smart contracts with encrypted payloads for free. Usually on a proper blockchain you would have to pay a gas fee for every transaction. Therefore, each time you fetch the smart contract code you pay. In a simulated environment, this is free. However, this technique relies on the testnet not removing the addresses. As of today, the smart contracts have been up for three months on the platform and they have yet to be removed. This technique of fetching payloads from smart contracts is called EtherHiding.

The sample above shows an Acreed smart contract that I found in the wild. The bits and bytes you see are heavily encoded and decoded by the compromised web application after delivery. 

Secondly, Acreed droppers have been observed fetching C2 domains and further payloads from Steam Profiles. This is a common technique used by infostealers.

Above is an Acreed steam profile with what looks to be a few hex encoded strings. Unfortunately, I cannot determine the encryption mechanism used to encrypt that string, that would live in the malware.

Both these methods utilise the technique called used as the domains are highly resilent to takedowns. Also, these two domains are unlikely to ever gain a poor reputation, therefore, they fly under the radar and evade detections. Furthermore, organisations are unlikely to treat these two domains as suspicious. If you don't have a detection in place that triggers upon this occuring, I highly recommend doing so. 

### Detection and Prevention

This infostealer takes advantage of the lack of telemetry that EDRs have. Therefore, EDRs will not effectively prevent this.

From top to bottom in my opinon these are the most effective solutions:
1. Browser-Based Detection and Response (BDR) Solution [BrowserBuddy](https://lvl0socanalyst.github.io/project/2025/08/10/my-19th-post.html)
2. Security Browser Extension to Prevent Clickfix 
3. Isolated Browser
4. [ZeroAttackPrevention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

If you aren't keen on a BDR you are relying on your proxy to block these domains upon connection requests, and your proxy is only as good as its IOA list.
