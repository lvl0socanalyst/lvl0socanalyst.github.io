## Overview

Standard Cloudflare turnstile that leads to a lure to paste a command into windows run.

### Dropper 

""INSERT ClickFix Prompt""

hXXps://alp[.]consulting

### .Wav File

I've got 11.5mbs of wav file.

When I open it up it is actually a powershell file. 

If we have a look at the clickfix command it actually saves the .wav as a .ps1

I assume this a method to bypass detection mechanisms that may prevent/inspect downloads with certain extensions (proxy).

### .Ps1 File

I'll save the .wav as a .ps1

First glance. Looks like some minor obfuscation. And lots of bytes.

![alt text](/images/ps1_netsupport.PNG)

What I can see:
- Creates a marker file in the /Temp directory as '__init__log'
- Writes some jargon on the screen. Likely to trick the user into thinking it's verifying there identity.
- Defines `$LjLSTACGF` as a file/file path `(Documents/HZze39v1.wav)`
- Defines `$xϞzzghϞ` and assigns it a lot of bits and bytes

Now that weird variable name `$xϞzzghϞ`. The lightning bolt symbol things is supposedly the greek letter 'Koppa'. Cool I guess.

Let's scroll down and see what else we have

![alt text](/images/ps1_netsupport2.PNG)

Now bit to unpack, I'll go through each line one by one.

![alt text](/images/n1.PNG)

Alright we've got the variable `$kKtyJL`. This looks to consist of the bytes in `xϞzzghϞ`, `mcZΛkϞπ` and `RζπrMwGEQi`

So, when I search for the two unknown variables `mcZΛkϞπ` and `RζπrMwGEQi` they muchlike `xϞzzghϞ` have a bunch of bits and bytes.

So what we are seeing is `$kKtyJL` now contains all the bytes from those three variables. So currently that is our payload/bytes we want to track further down this script.

![alt text](/images/n2.PNG)

So here it is writing the raw bytes of `$kKtyJL` to the variable `$LjLSTACGF` which if you remember from earlier is the filepath `Documents\HZze39v1.wav`.

![alt text](/images/n4.PNG)

`$weBRvm` sets the new desired file path `Documents\HZze39v1.zip`

And the second line of code actually renames the file `HZze39v1.wav` to `HZze39v1.zip`

![alt text](/images/n5.PNG)

These two lines create a folder in Documents called `PwNRbgjSHr`

So now in documents we have two modifications made by the script:
- `Documents\HZze39v1.zip` (re-naming and creation of .zip with bytes inside) ($weBRvm)
- `Documents\PwNRbgjSHr` (creation of folder) ($CRKaNcWH)

Bloody tough tracking all these varibles. But, we are interested in `$weBRvm` as that has the bytes!

![alt text](/images/n6.PNG)

Attempts to make the `Documents\PwNRbgjSHr` hidden.

![alt text](/images/n7.PNG)

Has a breather. Everyone needs a timeout.

![alt text](/images/n8.PNG)

Expands the contents of `$weBRvm` and writes it to the path `$CRKaNcWH`

![alt text](/images/n9.PNG)

Removes evidence of `$weBRvm`

It now lives in here `Documents\PwNRbgjSHr`

![alt text](/images/n13.PNG)

Creates a new variable `$ziπbKVG` and writes the bytes of our payload stored in `Documents\PwNRbgjSHr` to an .exe named `client32.exe`

![alt text](/images/n12.PNG)

Has another breather. Gee whiz this script must be working hard.

![alt text](/images/ps1_netsupport3.PNG)

Creates a few new variables here:
- `$wd` is `Documents\PwNRbgjSHr\client32.exe` file
- `$exe` is now `Documents\PwNRbgjSHr\client32.exe`
- `$quoted` is now `Documents\PwNRbgjSHr\client32.exe` which some character spaces either side.

`$cmdline` is assigned the string `'forfiles /p C:\Windows\System32 /m calc.exe /c "cmd /c start \"\" \"C:\Windows\explorer.exe\" ' + $quoted + ' \""'`

Well, this is new.

Forfiles.exe (windows binary) finds calc.exe (windows binary) which in turn opens explorer.exe (windows binary) to run `$quoted` which is `Documents\PwNRbgjSHr\client32.exe`

`cmd.exe /c $cmdLine`

Then it is ran using cmd.exe

![alt text](/images/ps1_netsupport4.PNG)

Now this is cool. Creates a run key in registry for `$ziπbKVG` which is `client32.exe`

Names it 'SecureModule'. Epic.

`try { Remove-Item -Path $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path -Force } catch {}`

Last but not least! Cleanup! 

Deletes the file from disk. That being the script we ran wayyyyy back at the start.

### Client32.exe

So let's try print out our payload `client32.exe` and whack it into some analysis tools. 

But first I've got to build it safely.

![alt text](/images/ps1_netsupport5.PNG)

I've commented out a bunch of code and renamed it to understand it. But essentially I'm building the file with the bytes and naming it `nothanks.zip`

Lets extract and peek inside.

![alt text](/images/netsupport_folder.PNG)

What we have here is NetSupport RAT.

Which is an RAT created by "netsupportsoftware.com" that has been re-purposed and used for nefarious reaosns.

![alt text](/images/netsupport_hash.PNG)

The hash lights up like a christmas tree in VT.

![alt text](/images/netsupport_strings.PNG)

Running strings on 'Client32.exe' shows the author 'netsupportsoftware.com'

What I now need to do is find an IP. Where is the beacon pinging out to. Yes I could run in a sandbox but that's not as fun as looking for a needle in a haystack.

### Finding an IP

`\b(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|1\d\d|[1-9]?\d)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|1\d\d|[1-9]?\d)(?::\d{1,5})?\b`

I got ChatGPT to spin me up this regex query looking for an IP and/or IP + port pattern.

I've then ran this regex query in the strings module in Detect It Easy (DiE) for all the files. And I have a few hits. But no clear IPs.

Whilst I'm manually opening each file in (DiE) and pasting the regex query in the strings module I had an idea. I can probably script this function using PowerShell and rather than give it one regex query. Give it 5-6. One for domains, one for IP, one for 'ClientIP' perhaps. 

So I'm gonna build a script to do so.
