## Overview

Windows Recall provides searchable memory across everything you've done your PC for our savour Windows 11 CoPilot. 

If you haven't heard of this, you are living under a rock. This is the update no one asked for. Literally no one wins from this.

### How it works

Recall takes screenshots of your activity and stores them in an encrypted .kb file in this directory. 

It uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text within these screenshots, allowing it to be searchable. 

```"C:\users\[your username]\AppData\Local\CoreAIPlatform.00\UKP\{some number} folder"```

You can do one of two things with these screenshots.

1. Open Windows Recall to view the screenshots themself
2. Use CoPilot to scan them and pull information from them

So a potential use case would be:
1. Spend the afternoon looking for a nice new laptop and you finally find one
2. Forget what the link is
3. Ask CoPilot what that laptop was from earlier you found
4. CoPilot reads the screenshots in the .kb file and gives you the information.

So essentially what we have is a DB that has screenshots of everything you've done on your computer during a session.

Now luckily there are some security improvements that we're added after initial outrage. 

1. The .db file contents are encrypted, using Microsoft BlackMagic. But if you can crack this you can see everything. 
2. Windows Recall needs Windows Hello to sign in.
3. No telemetry/screenshot data is sent to Microsoft.

### Why is it an issue

Well because everything you do on your computer has a screenshot attached to it.

So if an adversary manages to crack the encryption used in that directory it's free game. Which is kind of scary. Probably unlikely, given it's probably AES. But you never know.

An older POC labeled 'TotalRecall' existed for the first version of Recall. This was prior to Microsoft encrypting the .db file.

### How to disable Windows 11 Recall

As of June 2024 Recall has been opt-in. You'll be prompted this on installation.

If you are concerned that's it's enabled. Check through this method.

1. Open Windows search and whack in "Turn windows features on or off"
2. Untick Recall option
3. Restart PC
